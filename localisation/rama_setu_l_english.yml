 new_strait.1.d: "Since time immemorial, Lanka has been connected to India via a tenuous land bridge known as the Rama Setu. As described in the ancient Ramayana text, Rama is said to have constructed this link with the aid of his Vanara army in order to save his wife Sita from the King of Rakshasa.\n\nThough it has looked sturdy up til now, a recent cyclone has broken it, forming the new Palk Strait - seperating Ceylon from Asia."
 new_strait.1.a: "Incredible."
 new_strait.1.b: "Shore it up!"
 
 new_strait.2.t: "A Canal in Ceylon?"

However, there are some in our court that hungrily eye the passing cargoes of merchants, and they believe that constructing a canal across the bridge would position Vanni as a strategic and mercantile nexus. No doubt the construction will be costly, however..."
 new_strait.2.a: "We must begin construction at once!"
 new_strait.2.b: "Celebrate the legend of the Rama Setu instead."
