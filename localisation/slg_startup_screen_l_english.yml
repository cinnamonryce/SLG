 string_screen_title_ayutthaya:0 "A New [Root.Culture.GetName] Kingdom"
 string_start_ayutthaya:0 "A brave new kingdom, §Y[Root.GetName]§! has supplanted §YSukhothai§! as the dominant state in Siam, ruling over a relatively peaceful land from the ever-growing city of Ayutthaya. Peace however is not permanent, with subjects and enemies of the kingdom alike eyeing the fertile plains of the Chao Phraya. \n\nWhile [Root.Monarch.GetName] awaits [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] inevitable death, the looming threat of a foreign incursion lurks over the minds of §Y[Root.GetName]§!'s nobles, with the northern state of §YLan Na§! covertly sewing discontent in the now subjugated §YSukhothai§!. The de jure ruler of the principality, the [Root.GetAdjective] heir §Y[Root.Heir.GetName]§!, shall soon ascend to the throne of [Root.GetName], and it is [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] alone who may prevent its decline."
 string_screen_title_sukhothai:0 "A Relic of the Past"
 string_start_sukhothai:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! is no longer the dominant [Root.Culture.GetName] state, eclipsed by the newer kingdom of §Y[AYU.GetName]§!. Now reduced to a rump state around the city of §Y[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]§!, not far from the ancient capital of Sukhothai, the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] must find its path back to glory, or be lost to history. \n\nA chance for Sukhothai to reclaim its past however has presented itself, with the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] heir §Y[Root.Heir.GetName]§! dreaming of one day becoming the heir of [AYU.GetName], a foolish promise made by the [AYU.GetAdjective] heir §Y[AYU.Heir.GetName]§!, and one that [AYU.Heir.GetSheHe] shall be expected to uphold. Only time can tell the future of [Root.GetName]."
 string_start_lan_na:0 "A Million Rice Fields"
 string_start_title_lan_na:0 "A nation forged through the early conquests of the king §YMangrai§!, §Y[Root.GetName]§! has grown wealthy in recent years, with an abundance of resources and manpower attributed to its grain production. \n\n[Root.GetName] is currently ruled by §Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§!, a warlike ruler who came to power through toppling his father in a coup d'état in §Y1443§!, a move that left the kingdom in a brief period of turmoil. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s warmongering however has ultimately backfired, with the [Root.GetAdjective] vassal state of §Y[NAN.GetName]§! waging a false flag war against [Root.GetName], one blamed on the distant [DAI.GetName], and one that will surely postpone [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s wars in distant lands."
