In 1511, the Viceroy of India, Alfonso de Albuquerque, launched a second expedition to sieze Malacca, and in July, following a rejected ultimatum to release all the prisoners from the 1509 expedition, the Sultan strengthened his defenses to prepare for an inevitable invasion. \n\nOver the course of two assaults, Albuquerque's men conquered the city, pillaging the households of those not allied to the Portuguese.
