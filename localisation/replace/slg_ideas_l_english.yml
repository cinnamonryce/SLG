All men who lived in the areas controlled by the Shabdrung had to do military service. On top of this the Shabdrung also commanded an army of mercenaries. The Shabdrung's newly created state not only had to assert itself, on the one hand, against the Tibetan armies of the Tsang leader, who continuously tried to invade Bhutan, but also against an internal foe - a group of lamas from other Buddhist schools who were against the Drukpa hegemony - on the other."

The Provinces of Kurtoed and Kurmaed were combined into one local administration, leaving the traditional number of governors at eight.

In the course of the first Tibetan invasion, the general of the attackers fell and the Tibetan troops were beaten off. The fame of the Shabdrung as superior military strategist started to spread."
