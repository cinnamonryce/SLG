 heavenly_monarchy_reform_desc:0 "With unwavering obedience to their monarch, the subjects of the heavenly monarchies of Asia pledge themselves to a dynasty percieved as having divine power or authority, often claiming its right from the dynasty's founder. In most heavenly monarchies, a religious cult is centered around a monarch, with its members displaying extreme devotion to the state, as well as preaching radical loyalty. As a result of heavenly monarchies seeing their rulers as living gods, a plurality of these states are animistic or polytheistic in origin."

Should we wish to avoid a confrontation with these outsiders, we must intice them with free rein over our trade ports and mercantile sector."
