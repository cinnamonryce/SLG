 slg_prices.1.t:0 "The Clove Monopoly"
 slg_prices.1.d:0 "Spices like that of cloves had always been a luxurious commodity in the West, but the excessive European demand for spices drove global prices up significantly. With Europe's discovery of the clove-rich Moluccas, an archipelago part of a wider region dubbed the 'East Indies,' the Moluccans were pressed to safeguard their monopoly over the spice, leading to inflated prices that would later fund their rise to political prominence in Asia. While cloves soon grew to become one of the West's most sought-after spices, merchants profited from an increase in demand, with clove prices often soaring to a thousand percent their original value in Europe."

With newfound competition over the sale of the spice, global prices have dropped significantly, paving the way for a new era of the spice trade."
